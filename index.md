# Yoshida Lab

Dr. Yoshida's laboratory focuses on determining molecular mechanisms involved in the regulation of gene expression and signal transduction pathways in cancer development and drug resistance by using high throughput sequencing technologies and cancer mouse models. Dr. Yoshida has recently identified CDK4/6 as a target for therapeutic intervention in melanoma. Therefore, Dr. Yoshida has utilized a CDK4/6 inhibitor (CDK4/6i) to suppress melanoma growth. Palbociclib, Ribociclib and Abemaciclib are FDA-approved CDK4/6 inhibitors that have received a Breakthrough Therapy Designation and have emerged as a powerful anti-cancer therapy. They are currently being evaluated in clinical trials for many types of cancers such as melanoma, breast cancer, and glioblastoma. Dr. Yoshida's laboratory are currently working on dissecting the molecular mechanisms of both intrinsic and acquired resistance to CDK4/6i in order to improve CDK4/6i based therapies and to overcome its resistance in melanoma. Dr. Yoshida's long-term goals are (1) to discover novel cancer therapeutics by identifying molecules and pathways that are critical for cancer development and drug resistance and (2) to improve cancer treatments by identifying druggable targets and efficacious combinations for therapies.
